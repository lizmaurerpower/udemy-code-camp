<h1>The Best Movie According to Liz</hl>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>

    <hr />

    <h3>Devil Wears Prada</h3>
        <p>Who doesn't love Meryl Streep and a fashion montage</p>
    <h3>Rear Window</h3>
        <p>Probably the reason I love mystery and thriller so much. Great movie!</p>
    <h3>Pineapple Express</h3>
        <p>Purely because it reminds me of my brother and I love me a good ridiculous story.</p>
